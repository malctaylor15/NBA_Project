Previous versions and checkpoints are in the Previous Files and Attempts folder. 
The most current code is Second_Try.R which uses Curry2015-2016stats_clean2.csv . 
Curry2015-2016stats_clean2.csv is cleaned performance data from nba-reference.com for Curry's 2015-2016 NBA season. 

Quick project looking for a correlation between Stephen Curry and Under Armour (Curry Sponsor) stock price. 
I evaluated the overnight return in UnderArmour stock (when Stephen Curry was playing in that evening) on all the metric available for
Stephen Curry's performance. 

Initially tried using linear regression but switched to PCA because to the high dimensionality in the Curry predictors. 

More information about my progress is located in the NBA Progress Tracker.docx file. 

Thanks to nba-reference.com for having data for Stephen Curry's basketball performance.
